Association analysis between the SNP and BFT has been carried out using the MAX test proposed for case-control studies.
3072G&gt;A polymorphism (P(nominal)&lt;1.
1426A&gt;G polymorphism (P(nominal )= 8.
219G&gt;A polymorphic site in agreement with our previous results obtained in an independent study.
The top scoring pathway included 19 genes with a P(nominal)&lt;0.
