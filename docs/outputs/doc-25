Placing variations in gene abundance in the context of these networks, we identify both gene-level and network-level topological differences associated with obesity and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
We show that genes associated with either of these host states tend to be located at the periphery of the metabolic network and are enriched for topologically derived metabolic &quot;inputs.
&quot; These findings may indicate that lean and obese microbiomes differ primarily in their interface with the host and in the way they interact with host metabolism.
