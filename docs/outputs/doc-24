Obesity is frequently associated with breast cancer.
Visfatin, an adipokine, has recently been shown to be related to the development and progression of breast cancer.
Therefore, the down-regulation of visfatin may be a novel strategy for breast cancer therapy.
The purpose of this study was to investigate whether visfatin gene expression is affected by curcumin in human breast cancer cells and to characterize the functional role of visfatin in breast cancer.
Enforced expression of p65 protein increased visfatin promoter activity, whereas blocking NF-ÎºB signaling suppressed visfatin gene expression.
