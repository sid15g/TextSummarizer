The increasing prevalence of obesity in urban Indian children is indicative of an impending crisis of metabolic disorders.
Although perturbations in the secretion of adipokines and inflammatory molecules in childhood obesity are well documented, the contribution of common variants of genes encoding them is not well investigated.
Variants of four genes (PBEF1 [rs3801266] [P = 4.
Associations of rs2069845, rs1137100, and rs3801266 were replicated (P = 7.
These variants also were associated with quantitative measures of adiposity (weight, BMI, and waist and hip circumferences).
Allele dosage analysis of rs2069845, rs1137100, and rs3801266 revealed that children with five to six risk alleles had an approximately four times increased risk of obesity than children with less than two risk alleles (P = 1.
