Identifying metabolic syndrome (MetS) genes is important for novel drug development and health care.
Linkage analyses of this region in LG/JÃ—SM/J mice identify a highly significant pleiotropic QTL peak for insulin and glucose levels, as well as response to glucose challenge.
This focused human genetic analysis, incorporating mouse research evidenced that 3p26-25 has important genetic contributions to MetS components.
