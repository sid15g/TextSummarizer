the increas preval of obes in urban indian children is indic of an impend crisi of metabol disord. although perturb in the secret of adipokin and inflammatori molecul in childhood obes ar well document, the contribut of common variant of gene encod them is not well investig. we assess the associ of 125 common variant from 21 gene, encod adipocytokin and inflammatori marker in 1,325 urban indian children (862 normal weight [nw group] and 463 overweight/obes [ow/ob group]) and replic top loci in 1,843 indian children (1,399 nw children and 444 ow/ob children). variant of four gene (pbef1 [rs3801266] [p = 4.5 ã? 10(-4)], il6 [rs2069845] [p = 8.7 ã? 10(-4)], lepr [rs1137100] [p = 1.8 ã? 10(-3)], and il6r [rs7514452] [p = 2.1 ã? 10(-3)]) were top signal in the discoveri sampl. associ of rs2069845, rs1137100, and rs3801266 were replic (p = 7.9 ã? 10(-4), 8.3 ã? 10(-3), and 0.036, respect) and corrobor in meta-analysi (p = 2.3 ã? 10(-6), 3.9 ã? 10(-5), and 4.3 ã? 10(-4), respect) that remain signific after multipl test correct. these variant also were associ with quantit measur of adipos (weight, bmi, and waist and hip circumfer). allel dosag analysi of rs2069845, rs1137100, and rs3801266 reveal that children with five to six risk allel had an approxim four time increas risk of obes than children with less than two risk allel (p = 1.2 ã? 10(-7)). in conclus, our result demonstr the associ of the common variant of il6, lepr, and pbef1 with obes in indian children.
