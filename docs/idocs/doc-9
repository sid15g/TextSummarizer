the homeodomain transcript factor pancrea duoden homeobox 1 (pdx1, also known as insulin promot factor 1) is a master regul of pancrea develop, as mice or human lack pdx1 function ar a pancreat. importantli, heterozyg mutat in pdx1 caus earli and late onset form of diabet in human. despit these central role in develop and adult î²-cell function, we have onli rudimentari knowledg of the transcriptom target of pdx1 that mediat these phenotyp. therefor, we perform global locat analysi of pdx1 occup in pancreat islet. we us evolutionari conserv of target gene to identifi the most relev pdx1 target by perform chromatin immunoprecipit sequenc on both human and mous islet. remark, the conserv target set is highli enrich for gene annot to function in endocrin system and metabol disord, variou signal pathwai, and cell surviv, provid a molecular explan for mani of the phenotyp result from pdx1 defici.
