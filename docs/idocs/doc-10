optim lipid storag and mobil ar essenti for effici adipos tissu. nuclear receptor peroxisom prolifer-activ receptor î³ (pparî³) regul adipocyt differenti and lipid deposit, but it role in lipolysi and dysregul in obes is not well defin. thi investig aim to understand the molecular impact of dysfunct pparî³ on the lipolyt axi and to explor whether these defect ar also confirm in common form of human obes. for thi purpos, we us the p465l pparî³ mous as a model of dysfunct pparî³ that recapitul the human pparî³ mutat (p467l). we demonstr that defect pparî³ impair catecholamin-induc lipolysi. thi abnorm lipolyt respons is exacerb by a state of posit energi balanc in leptin-defici ob/ob mice. we identifi the protein kinas a (pka) network as a pparî³-depend regulatori node of the lipolyt respons. specif, defect pparî³ is associ with decreas basal express of prkaca (pkacatî±) and d-akap1, the lipas gene pnplaz (atgl) and lipe (hsl), and lipid droplet protein gene fsp27 and adrp in vivo and in vitro. our data indic that pparî³ is requir for activ of the lipolyt regulatori network, dysregul of which is an import featur of obes-induc insulin resist in human.
