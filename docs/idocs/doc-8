we previous report that adenosin monophosph-activ protein kinas (ampk) activ is lower in adipos tissu of morbidli obes individu who ar insulin resist than in compar obes peopl who ar insulin sensit. howev, the number of patient and paramet studi were small. here, we compar abdomin subcutan, epiplo, and oment fat from 16 morbidli obes individu classifi as insulin sensit or insulin resist base on the homeostat model assess of insulin resist. we confirm that ampk activ is diminish in the insulin resist group. a custom pcr arrai reveal increas in mrna level of a wide varieti of gene associ with inflamm and decreas in pgc-1î± and nampt in oment fat of the insulin resist group. in contrast, subcutan abdomin fat of the same patient show increas in ptp-1b, vegfa, ifnî³, pai-1, and no-2 not observ in oment fat. onli angiotensinogen and cd4(+) mrna level were increas in both depot. surprisingli, tnfî± wa onli increas in epiplo fat, which otherwis show veri few chang. protein carbonyl level, a measur of oxid stress, were increas in all depot. thu, adipos tissu of markedli obes insulin resist individu uniformli show decreas ampk activ and increas oxid stress compar with insulin sensit patient. howev, most chang in gene express appear to be depot-specif.
