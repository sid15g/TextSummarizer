combin differ approach (resequenc of portion of 54 obes candid gene; literatur mine for pig marker associ with fat deposit or relat trait in 77 gene; and in silico mine of porcin express sequenc tag and other sequenc avail in databas) we identifi and analys 736 singl nucleotid polymorph (snp) within candid gene to identifi marker associ with backfat thick (bft) in italian larg white sow. anim were chosen us a select genotyp approach accord to their ebv for bft (276 with most neg and 279 with most posit ebv) within a popul of ~12,000 pig. associ analysi between the snp and bft ha been carri out us the max test propos for case-control studi. the design assai were success for 656 snp: 370 were exclud (low call rate or minor allel frequenc &lt;5%), while the remain 286 in 212 gene were taken for subsequ analys, among which 64 show a p(nomin) valu &lt;0.1. to deal with the multipl test problem in a candid gene approach, we appli the proport of fals posit (pfp) method. thirti-eight snp were signific (p(pfp)&lt;0.20). the most signific snp wa the igf2 intron3-g.3072g&gt;a polymorph (p(nomin)&lt;1.0e-40). the second most signific snp wa the mc4r c.1426a&gt;g polymorph (p(nomin )= 8.0e-05). the third top snp (p(nomin)= 6.2e-04) wa the intron tbc1d1 g.219g&gt;a polymorph site in agreement with our previou result obtain in an independ studi. the list of signific marker includ also snp in addit gene (abhd16a, abhd5, acp2, alm1, apoa2, atp1a2, calr, col14a1, ctsf, dar, decr1, enpp1, esr1, gh1, ghrl, gnmt, ikbkb, jak3, mttp, nfkbia, nt5e, plat, pparg, ppp2r5d, prlr, rragd, rfc2, sdhd, serpinf1, ub2h, vcam1, and wat). function relationship between gene were obtain us the ingenu pathwai analysi (ipa) knowledg base. the top score pathwai includ 19 gene with a p(nomin)&lt;0.1, two of which (ikbkb and nfkbia) ar involv in the hypothalam ikkî²/nfîºb program that could repres a kei axi to affect fat deposit trait in pig. these result repres a start point to plan marker assist select in italian larg white nuclei for bft. due to similar between human and pig, thi studi might also provid us clue to investig genet factor affect human obes.
