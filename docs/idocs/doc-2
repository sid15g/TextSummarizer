identifi metabol syndrom (met) gene is import for novel drug develop and health care. thi studi extend the find on human chromosom 3p26-25 for an identifi obes-insulin factor qtl, with an lod score abov 3. a focus associ analysi compris up to 9578 african american and caucasian subject from the hypergen network (908 african american and 1025 white), the famili heart studi (3035 white in time 1 and 1943 in time 2), and the framingham heart studi (1317 in offspr and 1320 in gener 3) wa perform. the homolog mous region wa explor in an f(16) gener of an advanc intercross between the lg/j and sm/j inbr strain, in an experi where 1002 anim were fed low-fat (247 male; 254 femal) or high-fat (253 male; 248 femal) diet. associ result in human indic pleiotrop effect for snp within or surround cntn4 on obes, lipid and blood pressur trait and for snp near il5ra, trnt1, crbn, and lrrn1 on central obes and blood pressur. linkag analys of thi region in lg/jã?sm/j mice identifi a highli signific pleiotrop qtl peak for insulin and glucos level, as well as respons to glucos challeng. the mous result show that insulin and glucos level interact with high and low fat diet and differenti gene express wa identifi for crbn and arl8b. in human,arl8b resid â?¼137kbp awai from bhlhe40, express of which show up-regul in respons to insulin treatment. thi focus human genet analysi, incorpor mous research evidenc that 3p26-25 ha import genet contribut to met compon. sever of the candid gene have function in the brain. their interact with met and the brain warrant further investig.
