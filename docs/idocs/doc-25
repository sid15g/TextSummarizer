the human microbiom plai a kei role in a wide rang of host-relat process and ha a profound effect on human health. compar analys of the human microbiom have reveal substanti variat in speci and gene composit associ with a varieti of diseas state but mai fall short of provid a comprehens understand of the impact of thi variat on the commun and on the host. here, we introduc a metagenom system biologi comput framework, integr metagenom data with an in silico system-level analysi of metabol network. focus on the gut microbiom, we analyz fecal metagenom data from 124 unrel individu, as well as six monozygot twin pair and their mother, and gener commun-level metabol network of the microbiom. place variat in gene abund in the context of these network, we identifi both gene-level and network-level topolog differ associ with obes and inflammatori bowel diseas (ibd). we show that gene associ with either of these host state tend to be locat at the peripheri of the metabol network and ar enrich for topolog deriv metabol &quot;input.&quot; these find mai indic that lean and obes microbiom differ primarili in their interfac with the host and in the wai thei interact with host metabol. we further demonstr that obes microbiom ar less modular, a hallmark of adapt to low-divers environ. we addition link these topolog variat to commun speci composit. the system-level approach present here lai the foundat for a uniqu framework for studi the human microbiom, it organ, and it impact on human health.
