obes is frequent associ with breast cancer. such associ ar possibl mediat by adipokin. visfatin, an adipokin, ha recent been shown to be relat to the develop and progress of breast cancer. therefor, the down-regul of visfatin mai be a novel strategi for breast cancer therapi. curcumin ha anticanc activ by modul multipl signal pathwai and gene. the purpos of thi studi wa to investig whether visfatin gene express is affect by curcumin in human breast cancer cell and to character the function role of visfatin in breast cancer. we found that the mrna and protein level of visfatin were down-regul by curcumin in mda-mb-231, mda-mb-468, and mcf-7 breast cancer cell, along with decreas activ of constitut nuclear factor (nf)-îºb. we confirm the repress effect of curcumin on visfatin transcript by perform a visfatin promot-driven report assai and identifi two put nf-îºb-bind site on visfatin promot that ar import for thi effect. emsa and chromatin immunoprecipit analysi indic the bind of p65 to the visfatin promot, which wa effect block by curcumin. enforc express of p65 protein increas visfatin promot activ, wherea block nf-îºb signal suppress visfatin gene express. visfatin could enhanc the invas of mda-mb-231 cell and also attenu curcumin-induc inhibit of cell invas; on the other hand, visfatin knockdown by small interf rna led to the reduct of cell invas. our data demonstr, for the first time, that curcumin down-regul visfatin gene express in human breast cancer cell by a mechan that is, at least in part, nf-îºb depend and suggest that visfatin mai contribut to breast cancer cell invas and link obes to breast cancer develop and progress.
