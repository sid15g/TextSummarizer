we have identifi in the literatur variant in 64 gene that mai be involv in gene-obes-behaviour interact. personalis of behaviour base prevent approach against obes seem feasibl, howev obes genom is still in the discoveri phase of translat research and abund replic studi ar need befor these larg pioneer find can be extend to practic and popul impact. autom of search algorithm and develop of more effici tool for knowledg synthesi of genom research into gene-obes-behaviour interact might facilit the advent of wide avail personalis prevent approach. our futur effort shall therefor concentr on develop such tool, as well as a research repositori dedic to the us of public health genom for obes control.
