neurobeachin (nbea) regul neuron membran protein traffick and is requir for the develop and function of central and neuromuscular synaps. in homozyg knockout (ko) mice, nbea defici caus perinat death. here, we report that heterozyg ko mice haploinsuffici for nbea have higher bodi weight due to increas adipos tissu mass. in sever feed paradigm, heterozyg ko mice consum more food than wild-type (wt) control, and thi consumpt wa primarili driven by calori rather than palat. express analysi of feed-relat gene in the hypothalamu and brainstem with real-time pcr show differenti express of a subset of neuropeptid or neuropeptid receptor mrna between wt and nbea+/- mice in the sate state and in respons to food depriv, but not to feed reward. in human, we identifi two intron nbea singl-nucleotid polymorph (snp) that ar significantli associ with bodi-mass index (bmi) in adult and juvenil cohort. overal, data obtain in mice and human suggest that variat of nbea abund or activ critic affect bodi weight, presum by influenc the activ of feed-relat neural circuit. our studi emphas the import of neural mechan in bodi weight control and point out nbea as a potenti risk gene in human obes.
