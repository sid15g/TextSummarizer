multipl genet loci associ with obes or bodi mass index (bmi) have been identifi through genom-wide associ studi conduct predominantli in popul of european ancestri. we perform a meta-analysi of associ between bmi and approxim 2.4 million snp in 27,715 east asian, which wa follow by in silico and de novo replic studi in 37,691 and 17,642 addit east asian, respect. we identifi ten bmi-associ loci at genom-wide signific (p &lt; 5.0 ã? 10(-8)), includ seven previous identifi loci (fto, sec16b, mc4r, gipr-qpctl, adci3-dnajc27, bdnf and map2k5) and three novel loci in or near the cdkal1, pcsk1 and gp2 gene. three addit loci nearli reach the genom-wide signific threshold, includ two previous identifi loci in the gnpda2 and tfap2b gene and a newli identifi signal near pax6, all of which were associ with bmi with p &lt; 5.0 ã? 10(-7). find from thi studi mai shed light on new pathwai involv in obes and demonstr the valu of conduct genet studi in non-european popul.
